libqgit2
========

A C++ wrapper for libgit2

Feel free to fork this repository to play with the library but remember it is not the official one.

Currently updated to libgit2 0.17.0.


Authoring notes
===============

This library is largely inspirated from Laszlo Papp's ligqgit2 (https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/libs/libqgit2/).

/**
 * Description of changes to one entry.
 *
 * When iterating over a diff list object, this will be passed to most
 * callback functions and you can use the contents to understand exactly
 * what has changed.
 *
 * The `old_file` represents the "from" side of the diff and the `new_file`
 * represents to "to" side of the diff.  What those means depend on the
 * function that was used to generate the diff and will be documented below.
 * You can also use the `GIT_DIFF_REVERSE` flag to flip it around.
 *
 * Although the two sides of the delta are named "old_file" and "new_file",
 * they actually may correspond to entries that represent a file, a symbolic
 * link, a submodule commit id, or even a tree (if you are tracking type
 * changes or ignored/untracked directories).
 *
 * Under some circumstances, in the name of efficiency, not all fields will
 * be filled in, but we generally try to fill in as much as possible.  One
 * example is that the "flags" field may not have either the `BINARY` or the
 * `NOT_BINARY` flag set to avoid examining file contents if you do not pass
 * in hunk and/or line callbacks to the diff foreach iteration function.  It
 * will just use the git attributes for those files.
 *
 * The similarity score is zero unless you call `git_diff_find_similar()`
 * which does a similarity analysis of files in the diff.  Use that
 * function to do rename and copy detection, and to split heavily modified
 * files in add/delete pairs.  After that call, deltas with a status of
 * GIT_DELTA_RENAMED or GIT_DELTA_COPIED will have a similarity score
 * between 0 and 100 indicating how similar the old and new sides are.
 *
 * If you ask `git_diff_find_similar` to find heavily modified files to
 * break, but to not *actually* break the records, then GIT_DELTA_MODIFIED
 * records may have a non-zero similarity score if the self-similarity is
 * below the split threshold.  To display this value like core Git, invert
 * the score (a la `printf("M%03d", 100 - delta->similarity)`).
